# employee-database

a command line based employee tracker that accesses a mysql database

## Installation

This requires an installation of [mysql](https://www.mysql.com/) and
[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) to function.

Download the files of the repository and extract them to their own directory.

run `npm install` in the main directory

Open mysql in the command line and source the file at `./db/schema.sql`,
optionally source `./db/seeds.sql` if you want to populate the database with
some data.

This project assumes that the mysql root user's password is `"password"` if you
wish to use a different password you will need to alter `./server.js` to
connect differently.
