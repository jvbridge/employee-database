This only works because nobody else is named "Picard", This behavior is 
problematic when last names collide (such as for Beverley and Wesley Crusher).
For this exercise I'm going to just hard code things, but ideally a more full
implementation would reference a role they report to, and have unique roles for
each chief. (Data is chief of ops, Beverley Crusher is chief of medical etc.)
